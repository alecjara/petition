# Pizza Petition

## Summary

The idea behind this project is to create an online petition that visitors can sign to make their voice heard about a particular issue. For this project, I chose to realize a satirical petition, called "Pizza Petition", to make pizza free every Friday all over the city!

## Tech used:
Handlebars
PostgreSQL Database
Express.js on Node.js

## Features

The application has a user registration form, a login form and a logout option.
Users can add some personal information such as age, city and a personal web page.
Through the use of a canvas box the user can draw his/her signature to sign the petition
Users who signed the petition can see a list of all the other users that have previously signed
Additionally, users can view other signatories based on their city
Users can edit their personal information (city,age,homepage) through to a dedicated edit-profile page
Users can also delete their signature from the petition
